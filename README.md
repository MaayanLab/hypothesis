## Description

This project will integrate data from four Common Fund NIH programs listed on this RFA: Genotype-Tissue Expression (IDG), Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) for a specific purpose which is community-driven gene function predictions via data integration. Specifically, we would like to test the hypothesis of whether we can predict knockout mouse phenotypes (KOMP2) for understudied genes (IDG) using the omics datasets collected by LINCS and GTEx. To achieve this goal we plan to develop the IDG hypothesis page called Hype! The Hype! hypothesis page will address the following challenges: 1) Knowledge aggregation of understudied genes defined by the IDG consortium; 2) Harmonization of validatable computational prediction algorithms for gene function and target prioritization; 3) Automated benchmarking of prediction algorithms and assessment of prediction reliability; 4) Identification and assessment of predictive data resources; 5) Outreach to a community of computational experts that will engage in knowledge extraction from CF data sources. Overall, the Hype! hypothesis page will serve as a nexus platform that brings together key CF datasets across several CF programs for the purpose of synergistic knowledge discovery.
